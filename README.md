# Tempreture-code-converting-by-implicit-explicit-and-cast



Problem Statement:

(a) Analyse, build and run a temperature application TEMP3.cpp

The application will have a C++ class hierarchy consisting of a base temperature class and derived Celsius and Fahrenheit classes with overloaded constructors (including conversion constructors), ‘get’ and ‘set’ methods, and Celsius / Fahrenheit / Kelvin conversion. 

(b) Design the code for a derived Kelvin class (overloaded constructors, ‘get’ and ‘set’ methods, and Celsius / Fahrenheit / Kelvin conversion). 

(c) Modify the code for the main driver program to illustrates the use of the Kelvin class by allowing a user enter a Celsius or Kelvin temperature, convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin or visa-versa, and display the results. 	

(d) Debug, verify and validate your code. When validating use testing pre-calculated data.
